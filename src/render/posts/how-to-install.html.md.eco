# My Academic Webpage skeleton for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

>   Bare essentials for building a modern website with best practices

This is a fork of the skeleton [HTML5 Boilerplate with Grunt for Docpad](https://github.com/lukekarrys/html5-boilerplate.docpad) by [lukekarrys](https://github.com/lukekarrys).


## Why the fork?
This fork puts some more structure and some starting layout on top of the original skeleton (which is a boilerpate for itself).
You shall see the [Original README](https://github.com/lukekarrys/html5-boilerplate.docpad/blob/master/README.md).

This HTML5 Boilerplate skeleton for DocPad contains layout and structure with bare essentials for building a modern web page following also some modern best practices.

**Ideally, if you clone this repo things will be almost ready for you to have a personal webpage online in no time**, just some configurations need to be changed, and - naturally - some content.


## Getting Started

0. Install some tools following this "all in one videotutorial" for: `Git`, `Node.js`, `SASS/SCSS`, and `Grunt`
    __You can skip the part about  heroku and Susy__

   -  [Here is the tutorial for Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pjfs6lxFGo)
   -  [and here the tutorial for Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXikXodx-y4)

    For `Node.js` on a Mac, would be better to change owner to `/usr/local` with the following:

            sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local

1. [Install DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

2. Clone the project and run the server: open the terminal and run the following commands

    ``` bash
    git clone git@github.com:kuzeko/Academic-Webpage-Docpad-Boilerpate.git my-page
    cd my-page
    npm install
    docpad run
    ```
    this last command will keep running and keping busy your terminal

3. [Open http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and you see the current content

4. Start hacking away by modifying the `src` directory
    1. edit the properties in the file `docpad.coffee`
    2. customize the variables in `src/render/styles/style.css.scss`
    3. replace the text in `src/render/index.html.eco`

5. you shall see the webapge in your browser reloading with new content, otherwise `CTRL + C` terminated the `docpad run` command, and then re-run it.


## Includes

1. [jQuery JavaScript Library v1.11.2](http://jquery.com/)

2. [Modernizr v2.8.3, Minimum custom build](http://modernizr.com/)
